    <h1>Evan's Favorite Jazz Music Artists &amp; Songs</h1>
    <p>Jazz music started in the late 19th century in New Orleans, Louisiana with roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is
      typically characterized by swing, blue notes, complex chords, polyrhythms, and improvisation. Evan has been
      playing saxophone for nearly 8 years and found a love for jazz after he took music theory in high school. This
      webpage has a list of a few of Evan's favorite jazz artists and his top 10 favorite jazz songs.</p>

    <h3>Words from the author</h3>
    <p>It was very hard to decide on just 10 songs that I liked the most, there are around 100 jazz songs that I love
      listening to but it was fun to make a list like this to share on this webpage!</p>
