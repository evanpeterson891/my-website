            <p><span>Jazz</span> is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in
                the
                late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz
                Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz
                is
                characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and
                improvisation. Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.

                As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave
                rise
                to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches,
                French
                quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. But jazz did not begin
                as a
                single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big
                bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that
                emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from
                danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos
                and
                used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer,
                smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.

                The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel,
                and
                blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s,
                using
                the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which
                explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the
                late
                1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and
                highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz
                became
                successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century,
                such as
                Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.

                The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented.
                It is
                believed to be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning "pep, energy". The earliest
                written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league
                baseball
                pitcher described a pitch which he called a "jazz ball" "because it wobbles and you simply can't do
                anything
                with it".

                The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune.
                Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, Times-Picayune
                article about "jas bands". In an interview with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his
                recollections of the slang connotations of the term, saying: "When Broadway picked it up, they called it
                'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was,
                you
                wouldn't say it in front of ladies."The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th
                Century.

                Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition for "Jazz" from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York
                Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100
                years, from ragtime to rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective
                of
                other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst
                Berendt
                argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a "form of art
                music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music"
                and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a "special relationship to time defined
                as
                'swing'". Jazz involves "a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a
                role" and contains a "sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing
                jazz
                musician".

                A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: "it is
                music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual
                voice', and being open to different musical possibilities". Krin Gibbard argued that "jazz is a
                construct" which designates "a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a
                coherent
                tradition". Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, "It's all music."
